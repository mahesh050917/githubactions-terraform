Your GitHub Actions workflow for Terraform looks good, but I see that you're using actions/checkout@v4.1.1, which is not an official version yet. The latest stable version of actions/checkout is currently v2. It's better to stick to the stable version unless v4.1.1 was released after my last update.

Also, I noticed that the workflow isn't completing, so I'll finish the necessary steps and provide a complete example for deploying Terraform with secrets passed in the environment.

Here's an improved version of your workflow with some corrections and additional steps to ensure that Terraform runs smoothly:

Full Terraform Deployment Workflow Example
yaml
Copy code
name: 'Terraform Deployment Workflow'

on:
  workflow_dispatch:  # This allows you to manually trigger the workflow

jobs:
  terraform:
    name: 'Terraform'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    defaults:
      run:
        shell: bash

    env:
      ARM_CLIENT_ID: ${{ secrets.ARM_CLIENT_ID }}
      ARM_CLIENT_SECRET: ${{ secrets.ARM_CLIENT_SECRET }}
      ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID: ${{ secrets.ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID }}
      ARM_TENANT_ID: ${{ secrets.ARM_TENANT_ID }}
      RESOURCE_GROUP: ${{ secrets.RESOURCE_GROUP }}
      STORAGE_ACCOUNT: ${{ secrets.STORAGE_ACCOUNT }}
      CONTAINER_NAME: ${{ secrets.CONTAINER_NAME }}

    steps:
    # Step 1: Checkout the repository to the GitHub Actions runner
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2  # Stable version of checkout action

    # Step 2: Set up Terraform
    - name: Setup Terraform
      uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v2  # Use the latest stable version of Terraform setup action
      with:
        terraform_version: '1.6.6'  # Use the specific version of Terraform
  # Initialize a new or existing Terraform working directory by creating initial files, loading any remote state, downloading modules, etc.
    - name: Terraform Init
      id: init
      run: terraform init -backend-config="storage_account_name=$STORAGE_ACCOUNT" -backend-config="container_name=$CONTAINER_NAME" -backend-config="resource_group_name=$RESOURCE_GROUP"
  # Run a terraform plan 
    - name: Terraform Plan
      id: plan
      run: terraform plan -no-color
  # On workflow dispatch build or change infrastructure according to Terraform configuration files
    - name: Terraform Apply
      run: terraform apply -auto-approve
